# Lottery [![Built with ink!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/ink/master/.images/badge_flat.svg)](https://github.com/paritytech/ink)
A smart contract based on the ink! lang by parity to implement a simple lottery within a contracts pallet.

The whole logic is made by me but lots of the code is either taken or heavily inspired by the ink! documentation or their implementation examples.
